# Terms and Conditions

Standard Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) for orders placed online at typo3.com, typo3.org and its respective subdomains, from here on referred to as "our websites".
We would like to familiarise you below with our standard terms and conditions, which govern how we process and settle your purchases.

Our websites offer "Digital Products and Services", "TYPO3 Association memberships", "TYPO3 merchandise" and "TYPO3 partner merchandise" for sale and subscription respectively, from here on referred to as "products" and "partner products".
Products are all products that we offer on typo3.com, unless we advise that they are partner products.

## 1. Formation of contract and delivery of products

1. For orders placed online at our websites, we enter into German or English language contracts only.

1. When you order or subscribe to TYPO3 products, your contract is with TYPO3 GmbH, Emanuel-Leutze-Str. 11, 40547 Düsseldorf, Germany, and when you order partner products, you also have a contract with the respective TYPO3 partner. TYPO3 partners are specifically identified on each products’ details page.

1. By clicking on "Buy now", you are placing a binding order for the items in your shopping cart. Once you have submitted your order, we will immediately send you an email confirmation of your order. A binding contract is formed when you receive the order confirmation from us. Please note that items ordered by advanced payment (reserved) will be dispatched as soon as we receive payment of the full purchase price and any shipping costs. We therefore ask you to transfer the purchase price immediately after receiving the order confirmation, but at least within 14 days.

1. You consent to the assignment of the seller's claims for payment of the purchase price to third parties, in particular to TYPO3 GmbH.

1. Please note that, by way of exception, we are under no obligation to deliver your order if our suppliers fail to deliver stock correctly or on time, despite us having followed proper ordering practice at our end (matching purchase transaction (kongruentes Deckungsgeschäft). For this exception to apply, we must not be legally responsible for the products or partner products being unavailable, and we must have notified you of the situation without undue delay. In addition, we must not have assumed a procurement risk in relation to the ordered products or partner products. If products or partner products are unavailable, we will refund any payments made by you without undue delay.

1. We do not assume the risk of having to procure ordered products or partner products elsewhere (procurement risk). This applies also to orders for generic goods (where only the type and features of the goods are described). We are obliged only to make deliveries from our available stock and from the stock we have ordered from our suppliers. Our stock includes the relevant TYPO3 partner's stock where TYPO3 partner products were ordered. Where time periods are expressed in working days, we understand working days to mean all of the days between Monday and Friday inclusive, but not public holidays.

1. We inform you about the delivery time on each product detail page as well as before you place an order.

## 2. Prices, shipping costs and express delivery

1. The prices set out in the offer as at the date on which the order is placed shall apply. The stated prices are net prices, in other words they do not include value added tax. The products remain our property or the property of the relevant TYPO3 partner, as the case may be, until full payment of the purchase price.

1. Costs of shipping are indicated on your order screen prior to finalizing the order.

1. Express delivery is not available. Products and partner products will be delivered within 3-5 working days at the latest. If the products or partner products do not arrive within that delivery period, you will of course receive a refund of the delivery costs.

## 3. Payment

1. We generally accept the following payment methods: cash in advance, credit card and payment through Paypal. We reserve the right not to accept certain payment methods for a given order and to refer to other payment methods. You are responsible for any costs associated with money transactions.

1. In the case of credit card purchases, your card will be charged when you place your order.

1. You consent to receiving invoices and credits solely in electronic form.

## 4. Promotional vouchers and their redemption

1. Promotional vouchers are vouchers that cannot be purchased, but are given out during advertising campaigns or at our discretion and are valid for a certain period of time.

1. Promotional vouchers can be redeemed once only in connection with an order, and only within the specified period. Certain products or partner products may be excluded from the promotion. Promotional vouchers may not be used to purchase gift vouchers. Please note that a minimum order value may apply to the use of promotional vouchers.

1. The value of the products or partner products must equal or exceed the value of the promotional voucher. If the voucher does not cover the value of the products or partner products, the difference can be paid using any of the accepted payment methods. The value of promotional vouchers will not be paid out in cash, nor will it accrue interest. Promotional vouchers will not be refunded if all or some of the products or partner products are returned.

1. Promotional vouchers can only be redeemed before the ordering process is complete. It is not possible to apply vouchers retrospectively. Promotional vouchers may not be transferred to third parties. Unless we have agreed otherwise, it is not possible to combine multiple promotional vouchers.

1. If you used a promotional voucher when making your purchase and, as a result of revocation by you, the total value of your order is less than or equal to the value of the promotional voucher, we reserve the right to charge you the original price for the products or products and services you retain.

## 5. Gift vouchers and their redemption

1. Gift vouchers are vouchers that can be purchased. They may only be redeemed to purchase products and partner products, not more gift vouchers. If the value of a gift voucher is not enough to cover the order, the difference can be paid using any of the accepted payment methods.

1. Gift vouchers can only be redeemed and credits applied prior to completing your order. The value of gift vouchers will not be paid out in cash, nor will it accrue interest. Please go to "My Account" at shop.typo3.com in order to redeem gift vouchers and apply them to your customer account or to view your credit balance.

## 6. Statutory right of revocation in respect to TYPO3 products or partner products

**When you purchase TYPO3 products or partner products you have a statutory right of revocation:**

If you do not have access to a printer, you encounter problems downloading the return shipping label or you require a new return shipping label, you can contact Customer Care to request one (contact details below). Please help us to avoid unnecessary costs by always using the return shipping label when returning products or partner products.

**Information regarding the right of revocation:**  
You have the right to revoke this contract within 14 days without giving any reasons. The period of revocation is 14 days from the day on which you, or a third party designated by you (but who is not the carrier), took possession of the last item of your order.

If you revoke this contract, we are required to refund all payments we received from you, including delivery costs (except any additional costs incurred as a result of you choosing a delivery method other than the lowest-cost standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and at least within 14 days from the day on which we received your notice of revocation of this contract. Refunds will be processed using the same method of payment which you used for the original transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with you. We will not charge you any fees for the refund. We may hold off completing your refund until we have received the products or partner products back, or you have supplied us with proof that you have returned the products or partner products, whichever occurs earlier.

You are obliged to return or hand over all products or partner products to us without undue delay, but at least within 14 days from the day on which you gave us your notice of revocation of this contract.
