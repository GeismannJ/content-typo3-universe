# Statutory right of revocation

When you purchase TYPO3 products or partner products you have a statutory right of revocation:

The first thing you should know is that if you decide to return products or partner products, you can use the return shipping label enclosed with your order. If you do not have access to a printer, you encounter problems downloading the return shipping label or you require a new return shipping label, you can contact Customer Care to request one (contact details below). Please help us to avoid unnecessary costs by always using the return shipping label when returning products or partner products.

## Information regarding the right of revocation:

You have the right to revoke this contract within 14 days without giving any reasons. The period of revocation is 14 days from the day on which you, or a third party designated by you (but who is not the carrier), took possession of the last item of your order.

In order to exercise your right of revocation you must notify us (TYPO3 GmbH, Emanuel-Leutze-Str. 11, 40547 Düsseldorf, Telefon: +49 (0)211 20 54 36 0, Telefax: +49 (0)211 20 54 36 50, email: revocation@typo3.com) of your decision to revoke the contract by sending us an unequivocal declaration (e.g. a letter sent by post, a fax or an email). If you wish, you may use the attached revocation form, but there is no requirement to do so.

## Consequences of revocation:

If you revoke this contract, we are required to refund all payments we received from you, including delivery costs (except any additional costs incurred as a result of you choosing a delivery method other than the lowest-cost standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and at least within 14 days from the day on which we received your notice of revocation of this contract. Refunds will be processed using the same method of payment which you used for the original transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with you. We will not charge you any fees for the refund. We may hold off completing your refund until we have received the products or partner products back, or you have supplied us with proof that you have returned the products or partner products, whichever occurs earlier.

You are obliged to return or hand over all products or partner products to us without undue delay, but at least within 14 days from the day on which you gave us your notice of revocation of this contract.

The above requirement is deemed satisfied if you return the goods before expiry of the 14-day period. We will not assume the return shipping costs, you will be required to pay the return shipping costs. You are only obliged to cover any depreciation in the value of products or partner products if the depreciation is attributable to your improper handling of the products or partner products when examining its condition, properties and function.
